# PE06

## Overview
This folder contains four small Python programs that practice loops, user input, file handling, and basic error handling.

## Files Included
- `word_count.py` – Counts how many words are in a text file.
- `guest_book.py` – Repeatedly asks for names and saves them to `guest_book.txt`.
- `add_two_number.py` – Prompts for two numbers, adds them, and handles non-numeric input.
- `cats_dogs.py` – Reads cat and dog names from text files and prints them.
- `cats.txt` – Three example cat names.
- `dogs.txt` – Three example dog names.

## Notes
Make sure `cats.txt` and `dogs.txt` are in the same folder as `cats_dogs.py`.
